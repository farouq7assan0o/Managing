# Helping the Environment – Sustainable Tech Project

## Overview

Helping the Environment is a project focused on reducing the environmental impact of digital transformation by promoting sustainable practices within an organization. It was developed as part of a university computing course to explore solutions like recycling, refurbishing devices, and raising employee awareness. 

This project proposes a detailed recycling program, a tracking inventory system, and training modules to support a greener digital environment.
